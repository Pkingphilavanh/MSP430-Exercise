# MSP430-Traffic-Light
Running a little exercise.  
Datasheet &amp; Documentation practice. Learning a bit about the MSP 430 development board.  


Learning notes:  
I should have looked up specifications on LED light instead of just assuming they would just work. 
I am unable to find how much Voltage and/or Current the Digital I/O can drive on the MSP-EXP430F5529 board.
